					<td><p style="text-indent: 25px;"><Strong>W</strong>e designers love to fashion ourselves as “problem solvers,” but let’s face it: the line between solving problems and creating them is blurry at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of heels, or a $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural extravaganza in the Bois de Boulogne? The truth is, no matter what designers say, we have never simply answered problems. The act of design vacillates between the functional and the beguiling, often performing one while claiming the other. Le Corbusier dismissed the architecture of his beaux-arts contemporaries as cloying, while he looked longingly to the brutal utility of the grain elevators and factories devised by American engineers. A half century later, Rem Koolhaas jettisoned function in favor of performance:

					<blockquote><em><big> “functionality is boring; performance is about what role the building plays and what kind of scene it triggers.”</blockquote></em></big>

					There has long been an ideological divide between the utilitarian and the emotional, between rational design and the decorative arts, but the balance of power is shifting: In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut’s now cleaning up.</p>

					<p>The empathy economy is booming. Facts are out, feelings are in. This is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand-mania that asserts that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the IRS needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities, politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. (Is it only a matter of time before we’re debating our intergalactic positioning?) Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it means, but how it makes us feel. A brand is a promise. It’s the putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a particular product, place, or individual. So the new handbag makes us feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka, suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look alike, but it all has to feel alike. Whenever we encounter them we get that familiar brand sensation. That tingling tells you its working.</p>
				
					So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian, slightly-embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board has long been associated with the softer design arts — fashion, interiors, styling — that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators used them, serious architects didn’t. There’s no science to it, simply a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of Xeroxed pictures pinned to a foamcore panel or scattered on the studio floor, a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere. Their very vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don’t signify any one thing, but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a silky kitty, when juxtaposed with an angora bunny, a desiccated dandelion, and an eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the corporeal and becomes the essence of fluffiness. For the professional brand manager the mood board attempts to render, in a handful of swiped images, some vague quintessence that’s difficult to achieve with words.
				</td>
				<td><p>For fashion designers who are required to pump out a new set of allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential and highly confidential way to pinpoint explicit references before assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer recalls how when she worked at the brand in the 00’s, the mood boards were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch them. The foamcore was covered in different materials — linen for one collection, cotton for another — and the teams was required to use specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time, never stacked, lest the surface was disturbed. As almost proof of how far we’ve come, last spring for his men’s collection, Raf Simmons came right out and superimposed his reference images — a Japanese block print, an antique postcard, an astronaut — directly onto coats and jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to “mood boards you’d pin your favorite images to.”</p>
				
					<p>As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our clothes or living room to feel, to how we want our minivan or pharmaceutical or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood business continues to expand. (A friend recently told me her therapist encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the feelings related to her recent divorce.) This expansion is fueled, in large part, by the sheer overabundance of available images. It’s hard to remember that a couple of decades ago, finding pictures of things was actually quite arduous and involved countless hours of random page flipping. Now a few seconds of furious key-stroking produces endless examples to regurgitate. Every possible idea is immediately diluted by retroactive references. That glut of images is constantly resifted through personal curation tools such as Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration websites such as ffffound.com or vfiles.com. Such hyper-individualistic online collections, in turn, become open-source mood repositories scavenged by branding professionals. Why assemble collections of your own when there are millions that exist ready for appropriation? Need to evoke cozy softness with a vaguely synthetic overtone, an early seventies color palette, and just a touch of glam rock? Missile silo chic? Mid-century Crimean beach culture? I can guarantee someone out there has that covered. There are even Pinterest pages dedicated to collecting other mood boards: collections of collections. And then, of course, there is Instagram, which turns every individual life into a social network mood board. The carefully curated Instagram account is essentially a personal image management tool: private life as public brand.</p>
				
			While the ascendency of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to the lurking presence of Big Data. As vast files of meta-data and personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in god-knows-where, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences that at least promise something warmer and more human. When everything is available all the time and we’re inundated with information in every way, shape and form, we’re left no choice but to favor what makes us feel.</p></td>

			<h2>Reading Response</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Michael Rock's "Hooked on a Feeling" explores how contemporary design and branding increasingly focus on evoking emotions rather than merely solving functional problems. While discussing how brands today strive to deliver the emotional experience they promise. The author revisits the concept of mood boards—traditional visual tools used to capture and convey abstract feelings. As data and information constantly surround us, we continue to seek meaningful connections and emotional resonance.</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The reading remains relevant to contemporary interaction design by emphasizing emotional engagement and the use of mood boards to evoke feelings. Mood boards continue to be a vital tool in the design process, providing a tangible way to capture and communicate emotions. However, the rise of generative AI tools like Midjourney and DALL·E introduces new dimensions to design. These AI tools can assist designers by generating images that suggest certain feelings and inspire ideas. Nevertheless, they still lack the ability to evoke human emotions as effectively as traditional mood boards</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">If the reading is older or print-focused, its ideas can still translate effectively to digital contexts. The emphasis on emotional connection and branding remains crucial in design. Historically, designers used collages made from cut-out pictures in magazines or materials to find references and visualize ideas. Similarly, in digital design, visual curation continues to be relevant. However, the way information is presented has evolved, with considerations such as text size, scaling differences, and the transition from printed colors to digital screens affecting how design elements are experienced. Despite these differences, the core principles of emotional resonance and visual curation remain pertinent across various mediums.</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The author successfully conveys the increasing relevance of emotion thinking in design and due to the societal shift towards seeking emotional resonance and personal connection in design. This brought up the concept of using mood boards to experiment with different feelings evoked from brandings. This trend reflects a response to the overwhelming nature of Big Data, indicating a desire for warmth and human touch amidst constant information overload. The reading also illustrates the evolution of design from purely functional to incorporating emotional and aesthetic elements, mirroring broader trends in branding and personal expression</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The article heavily focuses on aesthetic values; however, the author didn’t discuss much about the balance between functionality and aesthetics. Aesthetic is as important to brand identity, but in the end, there needs to be a balance between the two. Functionality still plays a vital role in interaction design. Depending on the medium and the intent of the brand, achieving the right balance between usability and aesthetics is crucial. While a visually appealing design can attract users, its functionality ensures that users can effectively and efficiently achieve their goals. While intuitive, gut-based approaches value emotions more, interaction design often relies on a balance between an intuitive understanding of user needs and analytical insights. Successful design integrates both aspects to create meaningful and functional experiences.</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The reading highlights the significance of integrating emotional and aesthetic considerations, not just functionality, into design. As an aspiring user experience designer, it made me reflect on what it truly means to be a problem solver. In the booming “empathy economy,” we need to balance emotional impact with factual information in branding and marketing. I agree that the role of branding has shifted to focus on the emotional response it evokes. Therefore, when creating a strong brand, I want to ensure that it not only delivers a clear message but also evokes specific emotions when people think about or interact with it. This involves maintaining consistency in branding, including selecting the right colors and typefaces to ensure a coherent emotional delivery throughout the brand presence. Additionally, I plan to incorporate visual tools such as mood boards into my design process to help me find inspiration, encapsulate abstract ideas, and bring my vision to life.</p>
